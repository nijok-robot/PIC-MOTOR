    None

  @Param

/**
  @Summary
    This function makes the CWG to resume its operations from the software
    generated shutdown state.

  @Description
    When auto-restart is disabled, the shutdown state will persist as long as the
    CWG1AS0<SHUTDOWN> bit is set and hence to resume operations, this function should be used.

    However when auto-restart is enabled, the CWG1AS0<SHUTDOWN> bit will be cleared automatically
    and resume operation on the next rising edge event. In that case, there is no
    need to call this function.

  @Preconditions
    CWG1_Initialize() and CWG1_AutoShutdownEventSet() functions should have been called before calling this function

  @Returns
    None

  @Param
    None

  @Example
    <code>
    CWG1_Initialize();
    
    // Do something
    
    CWG1_AutoShutdownEventSet();

    // Do something
    
    CWG1_AutoShutdownEventClear();
